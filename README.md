# NouSystemsInterview

This project consists of a nou-systems module, with 2 components - one parent and one child (named literally ðŸ™ƒ). The child component just consists of a button that when clicked sends an event containing a `message` to the parent . The parent component then calls a `consoleMessage()` function when it receives the event and logs the message content to the console, it also displays a `message` letting the user know to check the console.

It's short and sweet! But this take-home project gave me the first opportunity in about 3 years to play with Angular, and the last time I did so it was AngularJS!
